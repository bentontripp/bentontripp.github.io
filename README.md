### About Me
I currently work as a Data Analyst at [Elder Research, Inc](https://www.elderresearch.com/). Prior to Elder Research, I was an undergraduate student at Western Governor's University where I received my Bachelor's of Science in Data Analytics and Data Management in Fall, 2021. I was recently admitted to Graduate School at North Carolina State University, where I will be studying Geospatial Information Science and Technology.
